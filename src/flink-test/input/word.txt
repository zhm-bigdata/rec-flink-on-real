it adds considerable latency to the analytics pipeline. Depending on the scheduling intervals it may take hours or days until a data point is included in a report. To some extent, the latency can be reduced by importing data into the datastore with a data pipeline application. However, even with continuous ETL there will always be a delay until an event is processed by a query. While this kind of delay may have been acceptable in the past, applications today must be able to collect data in real-time and immediately act on it (e.g., by adjusting to changing conditions in a mobile game or by personalizing user experiences for an online retailer). Instead of waiting to be periodically triggered, a streaming analytics application continuously ingests streams of events and updates its result by incorporating the latest events with low latency. This is similar to the maintenance techniques database systems use to update materialized views. Typically, streaming applications store their result in an external data store that supports efficient updates, such as a database or key-value store. The live updated results of a streaming analytics application can be used to power dashboard applications as shown in Fig
